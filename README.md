# LireJarp

Yet still a lot of boiler plate code needs to be written and creating JEE application quickly remains a challenge. Therefore approach described here shall provide a guide in how to setup an architecture implementing persistence and a RESTful interface layer. To do that properly a (reusable) pattern of inheritance + generic data types is proposed. This (yet unnamed) pattern is applied in persistence, Enterprise Java Beans and in RESTful web service implementation and therefore proved to be quite flexible. If you want to build an web-application, Project Builder provides you a platform to fulfill your ideas. Nevertheless, you have all flexibility to change your application. If you want to have a software which is easy to implement and easy to change, you should use standards. You will find these standards in the lirejarp project template.

LireJarp is the template for [LireJarp Project Builder](https://github.com/witchpou/lj-projectbuilder) and enables you to setup JEE projects quickly. It is driven by the idea to provide a project template 
covering:
* rapid project setup
* code standardization and naming conventions
* possibility to individually adopt code 
* create your own codetemplates
* rapid GUI design
** designer friendly HMTL and AngularJS frontend
** fast one-click deployment of UI changes
